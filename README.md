# Module-3_JWhite Python Challenge

PyBank This is a request to review financial recirds for a company. Using the dataset "budget_data.csv," I created a Python script to analyze the values.

PyPoll This is a request to review a city's recent election data. Using the dataset "election_results.csv," I created a Python script to analyze the values.

I used several resources to help with coding:
